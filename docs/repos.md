# Repositories

Our project structure is broken up into 3 sections, documentation repository for the mkdocs, frontend repository for React-Native  and backend repository for Java Spring. They can each be found below.

[Documentation](https://foodmobile.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - This links to the mkdocs site rather then the repo or, the repo can be accessed by clicking the github icon at the top left.

To run a local verision of the mkdocs, first install mkdocs and all the required packages
```
pipenv install -r docs/requirements.txt
```
and then to run the local mkdocs server run
```
mkdocs serve
```
[Frontend](https://github.com/FoodMobile/frontend)  - Contains source code for the React-Native app.  
[Backend](https://github.com/FoodMobile/backend) - Contains source code for the Java Spring ???(idk wat to say).  

All repositories are under the FoodMobile Organization Github which can be found [here](https://github.com/FoodMobile).
