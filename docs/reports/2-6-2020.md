# Project Progress 1 Report

## Accomplishments

We have discussed as a team which features of our app should be absolute and what additional features could be added later if time allows it. We have a fully laid out UI-skeleton of our app completed, including implementation of all the navigation actions between &#39;pages&#39;. We have started the back end and have created a few of the simple requests. Documentation is being made for the REST server so that the client can mock requests before they&#39;re actually finished. We have also designed the back end&#39;s architecture. Lastly, we are still thinking about ways this app could be monetized while also increasing potential interest from food truck business owners.

## Issues and Solutions

We have tackled a number of technical limitations and how we will achieve them. They are not yet implemented in code, but these are our plans for how to tackle the problems we&#39;ve thought of.

1. Problem 1: Fraudulent food trucks might sign up with bad intentions.
  1. We will require every food truck to sign up to upload a picture of their truck and license plate. We can also require them to upload their restaurant information so that we can verify it&#39;s a company licensed to sell food.
2. Problem 2: Live map updates
  1. Performing an entire http request seems bloated to be happening a lot. So instead we will use websockets as a way to relay all position updates from trucks to interested users. The same web server used for our REST api will also be a websockets server.
3. Problem 3: How to receive menus from food truck drivers
  1. We could make the food truck drivers enter the menu manually. They can list items as gluten free or other common dietary preferences.
4. Problem 4: How do we quickly sort nearby food trucks
  1. By looking further into MongoDB, it seems like we can use geospatial queries, and then sort given the longitude and latitude coordinates. We will rely on that, hoping that it has great performance. If that&#39;s not enough we may divide regions using quadtrees to cut down the search space.
5. Problem 5: How do we make an intuitive interface for both customers and food trucks
  1. There will be two separate interfaces for each type of client to use. The food trucks see one set of interfaces, and the customers see the other. They pick which one when they sign up. We&#39;re considering allowing food truck drivers to view the app as a customer to see things like how their store looks or how their customer&#39;s competition looks. This will also allow food truck drivers to become customers to other food trucks.

## Features Progress

The following is a more detailed break down of features we have implemented since the last report and what stages they are in.

## In progress

- Creating the UI with React Native
- Creating more requests
- Documenting the REST interface so that the client can start making mock code that we can use until the back end is completed
- Creating a persistence framework to make our interactions with MongoDB easier

## Completed

- The Spring MVC server is setup
- We&#39;ve created a few test requests
- We have designed the backend architecture
- We have created some mockups of what the app will look like
- We have a complete set of sketched UI designs for all pages we plan to implement at this stage

## Specifications

Our project will be composed of a couple development environments responsible for displaying information to the end user, and another for managing data given by users and food truck owners, processing payments, and delivering information to the clients and food truck owners. The back-end will be implemented with the Spring-Boot java framework to handle information, queries, and payments. The front-end will be implemented with React-Native to provide portability and cross-compatibility for the user-interface providing a simple platform for food-truck owners to list their products and location, accept payments, etc. and for end-users to locate food trucks in a map-style view, peruse menus, query for different genres of food-trucks, and possibly make purchases.
