Our project will be composed of a couple development environments responsible for displaying information to the end user, and another for managing data given by users and food truck owners, processing payments, and delivering information to the clients and food truck owners. The back-end will be implemented with the Spring-Boot java framework to handle information, queries, and payments. The front-end will be implemented with React-Native to provide portability and cross-compatibility for the user-interface providing a simple platform for food-truck owners to list their products and location, accept payments, etc. and for end-users to locate food trucks in a map-style view, peruse menus, query for different genres of food-trucks, and possibly make purchases.
