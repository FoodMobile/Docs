#### Continued work on app

The very next task that I worked on was getting Google Maps API to render a real time map based on the users current location. After that I started to work on showing different contents if the user is logged in, or not. This first started with making a sign in page that apon succesful login would switch to showing the main app, or if on failure notify the user why.
