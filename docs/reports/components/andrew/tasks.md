#### System Architecture and ER Modeling

Since the last checkpoint I have developed a coherent system architecture, and begun work on implementing Wrapper Classes and Connecting modules to bridge the gaps between different services (MongoDB, FacebookLogin, Google Login, etc.) and our primary backend server. I project by the next deliverable to have the database wrapping functionality finished, authentication services implemented, and begin utilizing these services through several classes represented in the ER diagram and UML.
